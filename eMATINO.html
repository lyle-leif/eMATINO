                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cybersecurity"> Cybersecurity </a>  the practice of protecting devices, networks, digital systems, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage through the use of technology, processes, and policies. The CIA Triad is a framework based on three principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which serves as a foundation for developing and evaluating security policies to ensure that data is protected from attacks.

        <h2>What is a cyberattack?</h2>
        <p>
            A <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/cyber-attack">cyberattack </a> is a deliberate attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer network, computer system or digital device. The goal is to steal, expose, alter, disable or destroy data, applications or other assets.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Today’s threat actors range from lone hackers and organized cybercriminals to state-sponsored groups engaged in long-term cyberwarfare. Their tactics span an ever-growing arsenal—malware attacks, social engineering scams, zero-day exploits and self-replicating worms included.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Attackers will exploit every kind of vulnerability, from unpatched web applications to misconfigured cloud services, to compromise a target system and disrupt its functionality. To mitigate these threats, organizations need layered defenses to help prevent, detect and respond to cyberattacks before they wreak havoc.<br>

        <h2>How attacks happens?</h2>
        <p>
            Cyber attacks can happen in a lot of ways, but most of these attacks can happen through fake phishing emails, calls, texts, and websites that trick users into revealing their sensitive information, such as passwords, or giving them access when the user clicks on the link. However, some hackers go for outdated software, weak passwords, and unprotected networks where they can easily access the system. Some use the old school trick— using a device such as a USB device that will implant malware in your computer once you plug it. But no matter how they attack your device, their goal is to access your data, spread malware, and lock your system for ransom. Most attacks happen because of human error, so it’s important to keep ourselves educated and digitally literate to keep ourselves safe.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="protect-yourself">
        <h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Strong Passwords & MFA<br>one of the most common ways to keep yourself safe from these attacks is to set a strong password that includes capital letters, numbers, and special characters, and avoid sharing it with anyone. Another is multi-factor authentication, where you will be required to verify a login more than once.
            </li>
            <li>
                Safe Browsing Practices<br>Setting strong passwords and installing antivirus software is not enough to keep yourself safe from these attacks. Practicing safe browsing habits like using secure websites and avoiding suspicious links is still the best way to avoid these attacks.
            </li>
            <li>
                Email & Phishing Safety<br>Always look out for any suspicious links or emails that will require you to give your personal information. Additionally, make sure to always verify the sender and block or put in spam any unverified or suspicious emails.
            </li>
            <li>
                Social Media Security<br>Social Media is one of the ways attackers can access you. Always be mindful of what you post and share in social media, only add or connect with someone you know, and lock your profile if you can.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mobile Device Security<br>Our mobile devices are prime targets for cyber attacks, and securing them is essential to make sure that our personal and sensitive data are always safe. Make sure to use strong screen locks such as a pin, password, pattern, or biometric authentication. Another way is to keep your device updated, make sure to always check for unrecognized apps, and only install from trusted sources.
